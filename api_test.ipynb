    "After scraping our dog images, it's time to evaluate the performance of OpenAI's Vision API. While our ultimate goal is to develop our own breed classifier using TensorFlow and neural networks, for our initial tests, we've opted to utilize OpenAI services. Our first step is to use Vision-GPT to identify potential dog breeds within images. However, we've encountered an issue with Vision-GPT's ability to provide concise responses. To address this, we're considering alternatives such as GPT-4 and simpler models like GPT-3.5, as they weren't sufficient during our preliminary trials."
