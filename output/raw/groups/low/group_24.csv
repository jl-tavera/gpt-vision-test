@dailydougie7.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0093088150024414,1.0,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, the following three breeds could be possible:

1. Pekingese – The dog has a flat face, a broad head, and appears to have a lot of fur, which are characteristic features of the Pekingese breed.
2. Shih Tzu – With its short snout and abundant fur, the dog also resembles a Shih Tzu, which is another small toy breed with similar facial features.
3. Lhasa Apso – The dog might also be a Lhasa Apso, which has a longer snout than the Pekingese and Shih Tzu but still shares the thick double coat and can display a somewhat similar appearance, especially around the face.

Without a clearer view and more information, it is not possible to definitively determine the breed of the dog, and it could also be a mix of any of these breeds or others with similar traits.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 189, 'total_tokens': 300}"
@dailydougie8.jpg,"(1080, 1080)",0.1258783340454101,1.0,"In the image you provided, there is a small, fluffy dog that appears to share characteristics common to a few different breeds. I can suggest three breeds it might resemble, although without a guarantee of accuracy:

1. Pekingese – The dog has a flat face, long, dense fur, and a solid, somewhat stocky body structure which are all typical traits of a Pekingese.
2. Shih Tzu – Similar to the Pekingese, Shih Tzus have a short snout and a long, dense coat, but they generally have a slightly more open face and less pronounced nose wrinkle.
3. Lhasa Apso – This breed also has a long, heavy coat and a similar facial structure, but Lhasa Apsos tend to have a slightly longer muzzle compared to Pekingese and Shih Tzus.

Remember that without definitive breed information or a clearer view of its physical traits, it's hard to be certain about the breed of the dog.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 203, 'total_tokens': 314}"
@dailydougie9.jpg,"(900, 900)",0.1128597259521484,1.0,"Based on the image, the dog appears to be a small breed with distinctive features that might narrow down the possibilities to a few breeds:

1. Shih Tzu: With its short snout, long, dense coat, and overall facial structure, the dog has attributes that are typical of a Shih Tzu.
2. Pekingese: This breed also has a flattened face, long fur, and a body type that could match the dog in the picture.
3. Lhasa Apso: Sharing similar traits with the Shih Tzu and Pekingese, a Lhasa Apso is another possibility due to the texture of the coat and the general head shape.

It's important to note that the exact breed can sometimes be difficult to determine from a photo alone, and there's also the chance that the dog could be a mix of breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 174, 'total_tokens': 285}"
