@lecorgi7.jpg,"(736, 919)",0.0822439193725586,0.8008705114254625,"The dog in the image appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. This breed is known for its short legs, long body, and erect ears. They typically have a fox-like appearance with a thick double coat that can come in various colors such as fawn, red, sable, and black and tan, often with white markings. Other breeds with some similar physical traits could potentially include:

1. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - similar to the Pembroke Welsh Corgi but with some differences, such as larger, rounded ears and a long tail.
2. Shetland Sheepdog - they have a similar double coat and foxy face but are generally taller and have a different body proportion.

However, based on the distinctive features visible in this image, the most likely identification is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 169, 'total_tokens': 280}"

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - Recognizable by their short legs, long body, upright ears, and festive demeanor.
2. Shetland Sheepdog - Often look like smaller Collies with long fur, pointed ears, and an agile build.
3. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - Similar to the Pembroke but with a longer tail and slightly different body proportions.

If you have a description or traits of the dog, I could potentially narrow down the breed further.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 140, 'total_tokens': 251}"

@loki_the_wolfdog0.jpg,"(1400, 1151)",0.2727785110473633,1.2163336229365769,"Based on the image you provided, the dog appears to resemble the following breeds:

1. Siberian Husky – Noted for their thick fur, distinctive markings, and erect triangular ears, the coloring and facial markings on the dog in the image are characteristic of this breed.
2. Alaskan Malamute – They also have a thick double coat and similar body structure to the Siberian Husky but are usually larger and heavier.
3. Alaskan Husky – Not a pure breed in the same sense as the others, but rather a mixed-breed category used for sled dogs in the Arctic, they often have a similar appearance to the Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute.

The exact breed identification can sometimes be tricky with breeds that have similar physical attributes, so those are three possible breeds based on visual cues.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 167, 'total_tokens': 278}"
