1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi
3. Corgi mixed with another breed (since precisely identifying mixed breeds visually can be challenging without a DNA test, the other breed(s) involved are not specifically identifiable) 

The dog has notable characteristics of a Corgi, such as the large ears, short legs, and distinct head shape.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 85, 'total_tokens': 196}"
@pavlovthecorgi8.jpg,"(168, 300)",0.0128412246704101,0.56,"It appears that there are two dogs in the image. The smaller dog in the foreground resembles a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, known for their short stature, long body, and erect ears. The larger dog in the background with a fluffy coat could possibly be a breed such as the Keeshond, Alaskan Malamute, or perhaps a Eurasier. These breeds often display thick fur, a sturdy build, and a wolf-like appearance. Without clearer details it can be difficult to definitively determine their breeds, but these suggestions fit the visible characteristics.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 112, 'total_tokens': 223}"
@pavlovthecorgi9.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0085096359252929,1.0,"This dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. Corgis are known for their shorter legs, long body, and distinctive ears and facial markings. Although I can only provide an evaluation based on this image, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the most likely breed based on the visible characteristics. There are not many other breeds with such a distinctive appearance, but if you are looking for similar breeds, you might want to look at:

1. Cardigan Welsh Corgi, which has similar features but with some differences such as tail length and possibly ear shape.
2. Swedish Vallhund, which has a similar body shape and size but different markings and ear shape.
3. Shetland Sheepdog, which could have similar markings, especially as a puppy, but would typically have a different body shape and size.

The best way to determine the breed of a dog with certainty is through a professional evaluation or a DNA test.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 191, 'total_tokens': 302}"
