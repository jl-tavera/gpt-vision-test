@madmax_fluffyroad0.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0079107284545898,1.0,"Based on the image, this dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. It has the distinctive features associated with this breed, such as upright ears, a fox-like face, and a relatively short stature. However, without more information, I cannot definitively confirm the breed. If it were not a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, similar breeds based on appearance might include:

1. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - They have similar faces and body shape but usually have a longer tail and can come in different coat patterns.
2. Shetland Sheepdog - They have a somewhat similar look to the face but have a longer coat and are generally taller and more slender.
3. American Eskimo Dog - They have similar fur and a cheerful expression, but they are typically fluffier and have a different body shape.

It's important to note that without more context or information, these are guesses based on visual features commonly associated with these breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 193, 'total_tokens': 304}"
@madmax_fluffyroad1.jpg,"(201, 251)",0.0107831954956054,0.8007968127490039,"Based on the image provided, the dog appears to be a puppy with particular physical characteristics such as fluffy fur, prominent ears, and a particular facial structure. While I cannot see the entire body, which makes breed identification less certain, I can suggest a few breeds that often display some of these traits:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi: Known for their short legs, long body, and erect ears.
2. Shetland Sheepdog (Sheltie): They have a similar look with fluffy fur and pointed ears, although they tend to have a narrower snout.
3. Long-haired Chihuahua: They can have fluffy fur and large ears like those seen in the image, but they are typically smaller in overall size.

Please note that without more information or a view of the entire dog, it is difficult to make an accurate breed determination. Additionally, mixed breeds can display a range of physical features that could align with various purebred dogs.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 193, 'total_tokens': 304}"
@madmax_fluffyroad11.jpg,"(201, 251)",0.0076541900634765,0.8007968127490039,"In the image, the dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. It is identified by its notable physical traits, such as its short stature, long body, large ears, and distinctive markings. Since you've asked for three possible breeds, I'll include two more breeds that may resemble the dog in the image to a lesser extent:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - The most likely breed based on the image.
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - Another variety of Corgi with similar features, though they usually have a longer tail.
3. Shetland Sheepdog - While they tend to have a longer coat, there can be some resemblance in the face and ears.

However, the first option, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, is the most accurate based on the visible physical characteristics of the dog in the image.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 173, 'total_tokens': 284}"

This breed is recognizable by its short stature, foxy face, erect ears, and fluffy tail (although the tail can often be docked in Pembroke Welsh Corgis). Other breeds that could potentially look similar include the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, which is closely related but typically has different markings and a longer tail, or a mixed breed with Corgi heritage.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 92, 'total_tokens': 203}"
