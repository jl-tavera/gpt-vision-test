1. Shih Tzu - Recognizable for their long, flowing coat and distinctive facial structure, which this dog seems to have, although its fur is shorter, perhaps due to grooming.
2. Lhasa Apso - Another breed similar in appearance to the Shih Tzu, with a heavy coat and a similar size, but Lhasa Apsos tend to have a longer snout.
3. Pekingese - Known for their flat face, long mane, and stout body, which could match the dog pictured if the dog were groomed.

Keep in mind that the dog in the picture may be a mix-breed or could have variations in grooming that make it look different than the standard depiction of these breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 185, 'total_tokens': 296}"
