1. Chihuahua – The size and shape of the ears, as well as the facial structure, could suggest that the dog might have some Chihuahua in its lineage.
2. Dachshund – The shape of the face and the apparent length of the body beneath the blanket could indicate some characteristics of a Dachshund.
3. Miniature Pinscher – The color and texture of the coat, as well as the overall facial expression and body structure, could also be indicative of a Miniature Pinscher.

Please note that these are mere guesses, and without more information on the dog's physical characteristics, size, and other traits, it's challenging to make an accurate breed determination. The dog could also be a mix of various breeds, which is common.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 194, 'total_tokens': 305}"
@tunameltsmyheart8.jpg,"(667, 1000)",0.0911111831665039,0.667,"The image you have provided features a dog that looks like a small breed with short coat and distinctive large ears. Based on these features, I can suggest three possible breeds:

1. Chihuahua - This is the most likely breed for the dog in the photo, given its size and ear shape.
2. Miniature Pinscher - They also have similar physical characteristics, although they tend to have a more robust build and pronounced hackney gait.
3. Italian Greyhound - They are small, slender dogs with large ears as well, but their body shape is typically more slender and elongated than that of the dog in the photo.

Keep in mind that without a definitive pedigree, it's difficult to ascertain the exact breed, and there's always the possibility that the dog is of mixed breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 161, 'total_tokens': 272}"
