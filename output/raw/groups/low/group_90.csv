1. Dachshund
2. Miniature Dachshund (if the dog is smaller than the standard size)
3. Dachshund mix (if the dog has some characteristics that are not typical of a purebred Dachshund)

It's always possible that the dog could be a mix that includes Dachshund, but from the image provided, it predominantly exhibits the characteristics of a Dachshund.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 133, 'total_tokens': 244}"

1. Dachshund - Known for their long bodies and short legs, often with a smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired coat.
2. Chihuahua - A tiny breed known for its alert expression and apple-shaped head.
3. Miniature Pinscher - A small breed with a compact, muscular body, often with a short, sleek coat and a distinct high-stepping gait.

Of course, the actual breed would depend on the specific characteristics visible in the dog in question.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 138, 'total_tokens': 249}"
