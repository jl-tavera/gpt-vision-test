@goldenunicornrae10.jpg,"(201, 251)",0.0100812911987304,0.8007968127490039,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, it seems to have traits that are commonly found in several breeds, so here are three possible breeds it could be:

1. Golden Retriever - The dog's coat color and fur texture look similar to those of a Golden Retriever.
2. Labrador Retriever - Although the color is lighter than a typical Labrador, Labs can have a range of coat colors and the facial structure could fit.
3. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever - This breed also has a similar coat shade, and the size appears to be in the range of a ""Toller.""

Without a clearer view or more information, it's hard to be definitive about the breed, but these breeds might share some physical characteristics with the dog pictured.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 158, 'total_tokens': 269}"

However, if you're looking for general information about breeds that often have a fluffy coat and a similar appearance as a puppy, I can suggest a few:

1. Chow Chow - known for their lion-like mane and fluffy fur.
2. Samoyed - with a thick, white, fluffy coat and a friendly expression.
3. Keeshond - a spitz-type breed with a plush two-layer coat.

These breeds are commonly recognized for their fluffy appearance, especially as puppies. If you can provide the image or describe the dog in more detail, I could offer a more accurate guess.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 140, 'total_tokens': 251}"
