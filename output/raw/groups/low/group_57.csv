@lecorgi5.jpg,"(1200, 1200)",0.0914564132690429,1.0,"The dog in the image appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, recognizable by its short stature, long body, erect ears, and foxy face. While it's not possible to conclusively identify the breed from a single image, and individual dogs may have mixed heritage, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the most likely breed based on the visual characteristics presented.

For the purpose of providing three possible breeds, here are breeds that share similar traits:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi – The most likely breed based on the prominent physical features in the image.

2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi – Another type of Corgi that is similar in appearance but typically has a longer tail.

3. Shetland Sheepdog – Although they usually have a longer coat, they also have a similar foxy facial structure and erect ears, which could make some individuals resemble a fluffy Corgi from certain angles.

However, the costume and hat suggest that the image may have been taken for a special event or celebration, and does not contribute to the identification of the breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 219, 'total_tokens': 330}"
