However, I can provide information based on the visible characteristics of the dog pictured. The dog in the image has a stocky build, a flat face, and a distinctive bat-like ear structure, which are characteristic features of the French Bulldog breed. Without being able to make a definitive breed identification, other breeds that sometimes may show some similar physical traits, although not exact, include the Boston Terrier or the Pug, but these breeds do have distinct differences from French Bulldogs and the one pictured here. The most likely identification for this dog, based on visible characteristics, would be a French Bulldog.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 133, 'total_tokens': 244}"

@emmatheminifrenchie11.jpg,"(400, 400)",0.0235261917114257,1.0,"Based on the physical characteristics of the dog in the image, such as the bat-like ears, stocky build, and brachycephalic (short-faced) muzzle, it appears to be a French Bulldog. French Bulldogs have a characteristic appearance that is generally distinctive. However, if you were looking for possible breeds that share some physical characteristics, you could also consider:

1. Boston Terrier - While they generally have a more squared-off muzzle and are often a bit leaner, they do share the short-faced look and can have ears that stand up straight like a French Bulldog.

2. English Bulldog - Although they tend to be larger and have more pronounced skin folds, English Bulldogs also have a brachycephalic face and a similarly stout build.

3. Pug - This breed shares the short muzzle characteristic and can have a somewhat similar facial expression, but Pugs typically have a different body shape and their ears are not as large or erect as those of the French Bulldog.

However, the dog in the photo most closely resembles a French Bulldog.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 217, 'total_tokens': 328}"
@emmatheminifrenchie12.jpg,"(2315, 2315)",0.6149463653564453,1.0,"Based on the facial structure, bat-like ears, and stout build of the dog in the photo, it appears to be a French Bulldog. The French Bulldog is known for its distinctive features, which are visible even with the costume. Since you've asked for three possible breeds, here they are:

1. French Bulldog - The most likely breed considering the visible features.
2. Boston Terrier - They sometimes share similar facial characteristics but have a different build and usually have a tuxedo-like coat pattern.
3. Pug - Although Pugs usually have a more pronounced muzzle and different ear shape, they share the brachycephalic (shortened head) characteristics.

However, the dog in the image predominantly resembles a French Bulldog.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 152, 'total_tokens': 263}"
