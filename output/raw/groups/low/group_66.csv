1. Shih Tzu - The round face, large eyes, and the way the fur frames the face is characteristic of Shih Tzus.
2. Pekingese - This breed also has similar facial features and an overall “lion's mane” of fur around the head that this dog seems to exhibit.
3. Lhasa Apso - They share many features with the Shih Tzu and Pekingese but often have a longer, heavier coat.

These breeds are quite similar in appearance, especially when groomed in a certain way, so it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between them without more specific characteristics.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 160, 'total_tokens': 271}"
@marniethedog2.jpg,"(1280, 960)",0.0923986434936523,1.3333333333333333,"Based on the characteristics of the dog in the image you've provided, here are three breeds that it might resemble:

1. Shih Tzu: The facial features, particularly the short snout and the overall facial structure, along with the long coat, are typical of a Shih Tzu.

2. Lhasa Apso: Similar to the Shih Tzu, the Lhasa Apso has a long, dense coat and somewhat similar facial features, which could match the appearance of the dog in the image.

3. Pekingese: The flat face, fluffy coat, and body structure might also suggest that this dog could be a Pekingese or have Pekingese heritage.

Please note that these are just guesses based on visual characteristics, and without more information, it's challenging to determine the exact breed of the dog. Additionally, the dog could be a mix of different breeds that share similar traits.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 186, 'total_tokens': 297}"
