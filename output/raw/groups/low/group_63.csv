1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - The dog has a coat, ears, and body shape that are reminiscent of a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. Corgis are known for their short legs, elongated body, and erect ears.

2. Shetland Sheepdog (Sheltie) - The face and fur texture, particularly the mane around the neck, could suggest some Sheltie characteristics. Shelties are similar to Collies but are smaller in size.

3. Long-haired Chihuahua - The size and facial structure might indicate some characteristics of a Long-haired Chihuahua, although it's less likely due to the apparent body length and overall size.

Since it's difficult to determine the exact breed without more information, and many dogs are mixed breeds, the dog could be a combination of different breeds that share these physical characteristics.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 208, 'total_tokens': 319}"

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi: Known for their short legs, long body, and perky ears, Pembroke Welsh Corgis are a favorite among dog lovers. They have a foxy face and a fluffy tail and are often alert and active.

2. Labrador Retriever: Labradors are medium to large-sized dogs with a strong build, short coat, and a friendly, outgoing nature. They are one of the most popular dog breeds due to their adaptability and family-friendly temperament.

3. German Shepherd: German Shepherds are large dogs known for their intelligence and versatility. They have a distinctive look with erect ears, a long snout, and a bushy tail. They are commonly used in police and military roles due to their trainability and loyalty.

If you can provide a description of the dog in question, I can attempt to make an educated guess based on the physical characteristics you describe.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 229, 'total_tokens': 340}"

However, based on your description, if the dog has a stocky build, a flat face, and a wrinkled appearance, three possible breeds that commonly have these characteristics include:

1. English Bulldog
2. French Bulldog
3. Pug

These breeds are known for their distinctive facial features and body structure. Keep in mind, without seeing the dog, this is just an educated guess based on the typical traits of these breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 126, 'total_tokens': 237}"
