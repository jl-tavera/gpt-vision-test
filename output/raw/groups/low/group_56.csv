@jiffpom9.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0064296722412109,1.0,"Based on the image you provided, the dog appears to be a Pomeranian. Pomeranians are characterized by their fluffy double coats, small ears, and fox-like faces. This breed typically has a very distinctive appearance, as seen in the image. However, if you're looking for three possible breeds considering varieties in appearance, here are three options:

1. Pomeranian - As already mentioned, the dog's features closely resemble the typical Pomeranian.
2. German Spitz - They are quite similar to Pomeranians but can be slightly larger with a similar fluffy coat.
3. Japanese Spitz - This breed also has a fluffy white coat and a similar body structure, although they typically are white and larger than this individual appears to be.

It's essential to clarify that breed identification by image alone can be inaccurate, and without more information, it's difficult to be certain about the breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 184, 'total_tokens': 295}"
@lecorgi1.jpg,"(300, 300)",0.0146093368530273,1.0,"Based on the image, this dog appears to have characteristics such as erect ears, a lush coat, and a fox-like face. Three breeds that could match these traits include:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Shetland Sheepdog
3. Finnish Spitz

Please note that identifying the exact breed from an image alone can be challenging without additional information. The dog may also be a mix of different breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 87, 'total_tokens': 198}"
@lecorgi10.jpg,"(700, 467)",0.0496397018432617,1.4989293361884368,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, here are three possible breeds it might be:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi – Known for its shorter tail and active, intelligent, and affectionate nature.
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi – Similar to the Pembroke but often has a longer tail and is a bit larger with differing ear shapes.
3. A Corgi mix – The dog could be a mix of a Corgi with another breed, which can sometimes influence characteristics like coat color, markings, or ear shape.

The dog displayed in the picture has the distinctive physical traits of a Corgi, such as a long body, short stature, upright ears, and a happy expression.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 146, 'total_tokens': 257}"
@lecorgi11.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0109720230102539,1.0,"Based on the image, the dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. This breed is recognizable by its short stature, erect ears, and foxy face. However, since you've asked for three possible breeds, here are three breeds with some similar characteristics:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - As previously mentioned, this is the most likely breed based on the visible characteristics.
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - Another breed of Corgi that is very similar to the Pembroke but with minor differences such as a longer tail.
3. Shetland Sheepdog - A breed that might resemble a Corgi in facial features and coat but is generally taller and has a different body structure.

Keep in mind that identifying specific breeds from images can be difficult, and dogs of mixed heritage can have characteristics of multiple breeds. The breed listed first, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, is the most likely candidate given the appearance of the dog in the photo.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 198, 'total_tokens': 309}"
