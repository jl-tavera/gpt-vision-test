1. Jack Russell Terrier: Known for their energy and intelligence, these dogs often have the coloration and size similar to the one in the image.
2. Beagle: They are also a commonly known breed with tri-colored coats and similar body structure. 
3. Rat Terrier: Similar in appearance to the Jack Russell Terrier, Rat Terriers can have similar color patterns and are also small to medium in size.

Without a more detailed view and other characteristic identifiers, it's difficult to determine the exact breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 139, 'total_tokens': 250}"
@eddie_jackrussell8.jpg,"(900, 900)",0.0508327484130859,1.0,"Based on the image provided, the dog is labeled as a Jack Russell Terrier, which is known for its intelligence and lively demeanor. However, if I were to suggest two other breeds that someone might confuse with a Jack Russell Terrier due to similar size or characteristics, the following could be possibilities:

1. Parson Russell Terrier - very similar to the Jack Russell Terrier, often differentiated by slightly longer legs and a more square body shape.
2. Rat Terrier - this breed also shares some physical traits with the Jack Russell, including the smooth coat and coloring, albeit Rat Terriers often have a variety of coat patterns and colors.

Please note that breed identification by appearance alone can be inaccurate, and the information provided in the image should be considered the most accurate.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 155, 'total_tokens': 266}"
@eddie_jackrussell9.jpg,"(512, 384)",0.0228939056396484,1.3333333333333333,"Based on the image provided, the dog appears to be a small to medium-sized breed with a short coat and a distinctive color pattern. Without being certain of the breed due to the image's resolution and the dog's position, we could consider the following three breeds as possibilities, keeping in mind there are many mixed-breed dogs that could have similar appearances:

1. Jack Russell Terrier: Known for their energetic demeanor and distinctive color patterns, typically with more white than other colors.
2. Rat Terrier: Similar in size and coloration to a Jack Russell Terrier, but often has a slightly different body shape and may have a different ear set.
3. Beagle: Though the overall color pattern is less typical for a Beagle, they can have similar coloring and are also a small to medium size.

Please note that without more distinguishing features or a better view, identifying the exact breed of the dog can be quite challenging.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 187, 'total_tokens': 298}"
@emmatheminifrenchie0.jpg,"(1200, 1200)",0.2280693054199218,1.0,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, it seems to be a small-sized dog with a light coat and a flat face, which may suggest it could be one of these three breeds:

1. French Bulldog - They are known for their short stature, bat ears, and flat, square-shaped faces.
2. Boston Terrier - This breed has a similar facial structure but usually has a more tuxedo-like coat pattern.
3. Pug - Pugs also have a distinctive flat face with deep wrinkles and a curled tail, although they typically have a more rounded head.

Please remember that breed identification by appearance alone is not always accurate, as many dogs may be mixes of multiple breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 142, 'total_tokens': 253}"
