1. Labradoodle - This breed is a cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle, often characterized by their curly or wavy fur similar to the one shown in the image.

2. Goldendoodle - Similar to the Labradoodle, the Goldendoodle is a cross between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle, also known for their curly coat, which can sometimes resemble the dog in the image.

3. Miniature or Standard Poodle - Poodles are known for their distinctive curly coats, and the dog in the image appears to share this trait. It could potentially be a purebred Poodle, either a miniature or a standard, depending on its size.

Please note that without further context or information about the dog's size, features, or lineage, it is challenging to definitively identify its breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 188, 'total_tokens': 299}"
