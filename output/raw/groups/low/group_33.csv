However, if you are looking for information on breeds that are commonly taken to dog parks, I can provide examples of such breeds:

1. Labrador Retriever: Known for their friendliness and energy, these dogs often enjoy socializing and playing in dog parks.

2. Border Collie: Recognized for their intelligence and agility, Border Collies benefit greatly from the stimulation and exercise found at dog parks.

3. Australian Shepherd: A herding breed that is highly active and enjoys having space to run and play, which makes dog parks an ideal setting for them.

These are general breed examples, and every dog is an individual with its own preferences and personality regardless of its breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 155, 'total_tokens': 266}"
