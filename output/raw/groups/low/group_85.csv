@popeyethefoodie13.jpg,"(201, 250)",0.0104427337646484,0.804,"The dog in the image has characteristics indicative of small companion breeds, which makes it a bit challenging to pinpoint an exact breed. However, here are three possibilities based on common traits:

1. **Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie)** - Yorkies often have similar tan and black coat colors and can have a similar facial structure to the dog shown, particularly when groomed with a shorter coat on the body and a longer, styled head of fur.
2. **Silky Terrier** - This breed shares many traits with the Yorkshire Terrier, including the fine, silky hair and coloring. Silky Terriers are a bit larger than Yorkies, but the image does not provide enough context to assess size accurately.
3. **Shih Tzu** - While Shih Tzus often have longer and more flowing coats, when trimmed in a certain manner, they can resemble the dog in the picture. Their faces can also have a similar ""button"" nose and rounded eyes.

It should be noted, however, that the dog depicted could also be a mix of breeds, which often produce unique appearances that might not be strictly identifiable as one specific breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 233, 'total_tokens': 344}"
@popeyethefoodie14.jpg,"(2048, 2048)",0.505335807800293,1.0,"Based on the image provided, this small dog could possibly be a mix of various breeds, so determining the exact breed can be challenging. However, here are three breeds that the dog may have characteristics of:

1. Bichon Frise – The dog's fluffy white coat and size are reminiscent of this breed, although the facial features don't entirely match the typical Bichon Frise.
2. Maltese – This breed often has a pure white coat and a similar small stature, but again, the face may not be a perfect match.
3. Havanese – The facial features and coat texture could suggest some Havanese heritage. Havanese dogs are small and can have a variety of coat colors, including white.

This dog may also be a mix of several small dog breeds, which can contribute to its unique appearance. The clothing and hat add a human-like quality to the picture that makes it quite endearing and a bit more challenging to focus solely on the physical traits related to breed identification.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 205, 'total_tokens': 316}"
