@bluestaffyboulder4.jpg,"(640, 800)",0.1442184448242187,0.8,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, I can suggest three possible breeds:

1. Staffordshire Bull Terrier – They often have a similar physical structure with a muscular build and a short coat. Their head shape and ears also resemble the dog in this image.

2. American Staffordshire Terrier – Also known as Amstaffs, they share characteristics with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier but are usually larger.

3. American Pit Bull Terrier – They can sometimes look similar to the first two breeds with a stocky build and characteristically strong jawline.

Without a definitive view or more specific information, it's challenging to accurately determine the exact breed, as visual identification of mixed breed dogs can be particularly difficult.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 146, 'total_tokens': 257}"
