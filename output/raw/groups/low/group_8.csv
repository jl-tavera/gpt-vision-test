@_gsdbear6.jpg,"(640, 800)",0.151738166809082,0.8,"The dog in the image appears to be a German Shepherd. This is indicated by the following breed-specific characteristics:

1. The dog has a black mask, which is typical of the German Shepherd breed.
2. It has a tan and black coat, which is also common among German Shepherds.
3. The structure of the ears (standing up) and the shape of the muzzle are consistent with a German Shepherd.

While this dog appears to be a German Shepherd based on these visual cues, please note that without genetic testing or breed papers, it's not possible to guarantee the breed with 100% certainty. German Shepherds are a distinct and recognizable breed, so other breeds may not closely resemble them, but there can be mix-breeds that share similar traits.","{'prompt_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens': 155, 'total_tokens': 266}"
