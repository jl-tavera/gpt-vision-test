1. Labradoodle - This is a popular hybrid breed that combines a Labrador Retriever with a Poodle. They are known for their friendly demeanor and hypoallergenic coats that may range from straight to curly.

2. Goldendoodle - Another designer crossbreed, this one between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. They exhibit similar characteristics to the Labradoodle with a typically shaggy or wavy coat.

3. Cockapoo - This breed is a cross between a Cocker Spaniel and a Poodle, known for their smaller size compared to the first two breeds and their wavy or curly coat.

It's important to note that without a clear indication of the breed from the owner or a genetic test, it can be challenging to determine the exact breed of a dog, especially with mixed breeds which often have varied characteristics.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 208, 'total_tokens': 999}"
@reagandoodle9.jpg,"(1200, 630)",0.0968751907348632,1.9047619047619049,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, here are three possible breeds:

1. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel - This breed often has a similar fur color and soft, wavy coat.
2. Cocker Spaniel - They also have long, wavy ears and a similar coat texture.
3. Cockapoo - A mixed breed combining aspects of Cocker Spaniels and Poodles, which can result in a similar coat and color.

Please note that without a clear full-body view and other distinctive breed traits, this is a speculative assessment based on visible characteristics in the image.","{'prompt_tokens': 1131, 'completion_tokens': 121, 'total_tokens': 1252}"

If considering other similar-looking breeds, three possibilities may include:

1. Old English Sheepdog
2. Bearded Collie
3. Polish Lowland Sheepdog

However, the most likely breed from this image seems to be an Old English Sheepdog.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 94, 'total_tokens': 885}"
