1. Samoyed: Known for their fluffy white coat, large smile, and friendly disposition.
2. American Eskimo Dog: They have a similar plush white coat and can have a comparable size and facial structure; however, they usually have more of a spitz-type face.
3. Japanese Spitz: They are smaller than Samoyeds but have a similar fluffy white coat and happy expression.

Of these three, the dog most closely resembles the characteristics of a Samoyed. However, without a genetic test, it's not possible to determine the breed with absolute certainty.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 127, 'total_tokens': 918}"
