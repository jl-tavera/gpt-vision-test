1. Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie) – It could be a mixed breed or a Yorkie with a haircut that is different from the breed's traditional show grooming standards.
2. Maltese – This dog could be a Maltese or a Maltese mix, especially if its coat is normally pure white but has a bit of staining or discoloration.
3. Morkie – This is a mix between a Maltese and a Yorkshire Terrier, which can have varying coat colors and textures, often exhibiting traits from both parent breeds.

Please note that without a DNA test or confirmation from the owner, the exact breed can't be determined, and mixed breed dogs can have a wide range of appearances that draw from multiple breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 194, 'total_tokens': 985}"

@ppteamaria11.jpg,"(1080, 1080)",0.1675310134887695,1.0,"Based on the image provided, the dog appears to be a Dachshund. Dachshunds are characterized by their long bodies, short legs, and typically have a smooth, wiry, or long coat. However, for the purpose of the exercise, I'll list three breeds that share some physical characteristics with the dog in the picture.

1. Dachshund – This breed is the closest match due to its distinctive body shape and coat.
2. Basset Hound – Though generally much larger and with more pronounced drooping ears, Basset Hounds share the trait of having short legs relative to their body size.
3. Beagle – While Beagles are typically more proportionally built and have a different head shape, they may share the color and a smooth coat with the dog in the picture.

Among these options, the first one, Dachshund, is almost certainly the correct breed of the dog in the image.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 192, 'total_tokens': 983}"
@ppteamaria13.jpg,"(1200, 1056)",0.1648550033569336,1.1363636363636365,"Based on the image provided, it's clear that the dog has a very distinctive body shape and appearance. Here are three possible breeds the dog could be:

1. **Dachshund**: This dog seems to have the long body and short legs that are characteristic of the Dachshund breed, also known as the Wiener Dog. The dog's facial features, with the long muzzle and floppy ears, are also common for Dachshunds.

2. **Basset Hound**: Although less likely due to the body being long rather than stout, the droopy ears and the sad eyes could potentially suggest a Basset Hound influence, especially given the similarity in ear shape and face.

3. **Beagle**: While Beagles are generally more compact and less elongated than this particular dog, the color and the face could be somewhat reminiscent of a Beagle.

The most likely breed from these options, judging solely from the photograph, would be the Dachshund.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 200, 'total_tokens': 991}"
