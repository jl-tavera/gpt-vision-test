@dogwithsign4.jpg,"(700, 875)",0.1936225891113281,0.8,"Based on the dog's appearance in the image, here are three possible breeds or types of dogs it could be:

1. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel mix - The dog appears to have a silky coat and spaniel-like ears.
2. Yorkshire Terrier mix - The coloration and texture of the coat, as well as the size, suggest it could have some Yorkshire Terrier genetics.
3. Dachshund mix - The dog's body shape and possibly the fur texture could indicate some Dachshund heritage, especially if it has a long body compared to its legs.

It's important to note that these are just guesses based on the dog's physical characteristics seen in the picture, and without a DNA test, it's impossible to know the exact breed mix of a dog. The dog could also be a mix of more than one breed that isn't listed here.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 177, 'total_tokens': 968}"

@dogwithsign6.jpg,"(1456, 1456)",0.2319602966308593,1.0,"The dog in the image has features that could suggest it belongs to one of several breeds, including but not limited to the following:

1. Yorkshire Terrier - Often known for their small size and long, silky coats that can be a variety of colors including the black and tan often seen in Yorkies.

2. Silky Terrier - Similar to the Yorkshire Terrier in size and coat type, the Silky Terrier typically has a fine, silky hair coat that can also be black and tan.

3. Schnauzer Mix - The dog's beard and eyebrows could suggest some Schnauzer influence, especially given the texture of the coat and coloration, though mixed breeds can have diverse appearances.

Keep in mind that without more information, it's difficult to determine the exact breed, and this dog could well be a mix of several different breeds. It displays characteristics that are common to certain terrier breeds or terrier mixes.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 187, 'total_tokens': 978}"
@dogwithsign7.jpg,"(700, 875)",0.1276636123657226,0.8,"The dog in the image appears to be a small terrier with a wiry coat. Based on these visual traits, three possible breeds or types that the dog might be are:

1. Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie) – Their coat can often appear in similar coloration and texture.
2. Silky Terrier – Like the Yorkshire Terrier, they share a similar coat and size.
3. Dachshund/Terrier Mix – The dog's body structure and coat could suggest a mix which might include Dachshund traits blended with that of a terrier breed.

Please note that without knowing the specific lineage of this dog, these are educated guesses based on its visible characteristics. Identifying a precise breed or mix can be challenging without genetic testing or breed-specific knowledge.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 158, 'total_tokens': 949}"
@dogwithsign8.jpg,"(700, 875)",0.1424570083618164,0.8,"The dog in the image appears to be a small breed with a scruffy, wiry coat and a cute facial expression. While pinpointing the exact breed from a single image can be challenging, here are three potential breeds this dog might have in its lineage:

1. Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie) - It might have some characteristics similar to a Yorkie, especially the coat texture and coloration.
2. Dachshund - The dog seems to have the body shape and coat that might suggest part Dachshund.
3. Schnauzer - Some facial features and the wiry coat could indicate Schnauzer heritage, though Schnauzers are typically larger.

It's worth mentioning that mixed-breeds can exhibit physical characteristics from multiple breeds, so the dog could potentially be a mix of several different small, wiry-coated breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 171, 'total_tokens': 962}"
