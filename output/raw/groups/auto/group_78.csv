@norbertthedog11.jpg,"(2500, 2500)",0.6308832168579102,1.0,"Based on the image provided, the dog appears to be a small, fluffy breed with distinctive facial features. While I am not able to conclusively identify the breed, here are three possible breeds that this dog could resemble:

1. Shih Tzu - Noted for their adorable face, long silky fur, and affectionate nature, Shih Tzus are a common small breed that can have a similar appearance.

2. Maltese - Maltese dogs are known for their pure white fur and gentle, playful expression, although the dog in the photo has a different fur color, the ear style and facial characteristics could suggest some Maltese heritage.

3. Lhasa Apso - Originating from Tibet, Lhasa Apsos have long, dense coats and a loyal temperament. The dog's face, including the way the hair on the head is styled, may resemble that of a Lhasa Apso.

Please note that without a definitive breed identification, these suggestions are based on visual similarities and the actual breed could be different or even a mix of multiple breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 220, 'total_tokens': 1011}"

While I cannot definitively identify the breed of the dog in the image, I can suggest three breeds that it might resemble:

1. Maltese - Known for their silky, white coat and affectionate nature, Maltese dogs are small breed companions with a similar facial structure and fur texture to the dog in the image.

2. Shih Tzu - Shih Tzus often have a longer coat that requires regular grooming, and they can have similar facial expressions to the dog in the picture. Their faces are characterized by a short, square muzzle and large eyes.
