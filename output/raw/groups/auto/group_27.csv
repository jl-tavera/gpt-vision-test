@dogwithsign9.jpg,"(1200, 630)",0.1085529327392578,1.9047619047619049,"Based on the characteristics visible in the images provided, the dog appears to have traits that are similar to those found in the following breeds:

1. Yorkshire Terrier: This breed is known for its long, silky coat and its small size. The dog's face has a texture and color pattern that could be seen in a Yorkshire Terrier, particularly if it's groomed in a certain style or has fur of varying lengths.

2. Schnauzer: Schnauzers are known for their distinctive bearded snout and wiry coat. The dog in the picture has facial features that resemble this breed.

3. Dachshund: The dog's body shape and size could potentially fit those of a Dachshund, especially considering the breed's variation in coat types (smooth, long-haired, or wire-haired), but this is less conclusive without a clear view of the dog's overall body proportions.

This dog may also be a mix of any of these breeds, or other breeds entirely, and without a clear pedigree, it's often difficult to accurately determine the exact breed(s) involved.","{'prompt_tokens': 1131, 'completion_tokens': 220, 'total_tokens': 1351}"
@eddie_jackrussell0.jpg,"(576, 700)",0.0519561767578125,0.8228571428571428,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, I could suggest that it might belong to one of the following three breeds or perhaps a mix involving them:

1. Jack Russell Terrier: This breed is known for its small size, athletic build, and smooth or rough coat with a pattern that can be similar to the one shown on the dog in the photograph.
2. Parson Russell Terrier: Very similar to the Jack Russell Terrier, Parson Russell Terriers can have a slightly different body shape and are generally taller and longer-legged.
3. Rat Terrier: This breed often exhibits similar coloring and patterns to the dog depicted, and while they can vary in size, some Rat Terriers have a similar look.

The dog could also be a mixed breed with characteristics from different terriers or other breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 165, 'total_tokens': 956}"
@eddie_jackrussell1.jpg,"(1400, 700)",0.0991535186767578,2.0,"The dog in the image appears to be a Jack Russell Terrier. This breed is known for its high energy, intelligence, and predominantly white coat with brown and/or black markings. Jack Russell Terriers are small to medium-sized and are often seen in various media due to their trainability and expressive faces.

While my main capability is to provide a likely breed based on the characteristics visible in the picture, here are two other breeds that have some similar features and could possibly be considered based on coat color and size, although they are not as close a match as the Jack Russell Terrier:

1. Parson Russell Terrier - They are similar to the Jack Russell Terrier with slight differences primarily in their height and proportions.
2. Rat Terrier - This breed also has a similar color pattern and size but typically has different body proportions and ear shapes.

It's important to note that individual dogs in a breed can vary, and terrier breeds, in particular, have a wide range of individual appearances, especially if they are mixed breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 1131, 'completion_tokens': 207, 'total_tokens': 1338}"
@eddie_jackrussell10.jpg,"(300, 168)",0.0070819854736328,1.7857142857142858,"Without the ability to visually identify specifics, I can provide some educated guesses based on the general appearance of the dog in the photo. The dog seems to have a short coat, a predominantly white body with some larger patches of color, possibly brown or tan, and the size appears to be small to medium. Given these characteristics, here are three dog breeds that the dog in the image may resemble:

1. Jack Russell Terrier: Known for their high energy and distinctive coat patterns that often include white, brown, and/or black markings.
2. Rat Terrier: These dogs are similar in size to the Jack Russell Terrier and also have a smooth coat with various color patterns including white and tan.
3. Parson Russell Terrier: Like the Jack Russell, the Parson Russell Terrier has a wiry or smooth coat with a predominance of white and distinctive facial color patches.

Please note that without a clear view of more specific physical traits such as ear shape, tail type, and exact body proportions, itâ€™s not possible to accurately determine the breed from the image alone. The dog could also be a mix of various breeds or a breed not listed here.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 234, 'total_tokens': 515}"
@eddie_jackrussell11.jpg,"(720, 900)",0.0417652130126953,0.8,"Based on the image you've provided, the dog appears to be a small and wiry-coated breed. Three possible breeds that the dog could be, taking into account variability within breeds and individual appearances, could be:

1. Jack Russell Terrier - They are known for their small size, alert expression, and their smooth or rough coats which can include patchy coloration similar to the one seen in the picture.
2. Parson Russell Terrier - Very similar to the Jack Russell Terrier and can sometimes be confused with them but typically they have longer legs and a more square body profile.
3. Rat Terrier - These dogs have a varied coat type and also can display the kind of coloration we see in the image, with patches of color over a white base.

Please note that without a genetic test or verified pedigree, it's not possible to be certain of a dog's breed, and physical characteristics can sometimes be misleading, especially in cases of mixed-breed dogs.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 198, 'total_tokens': 989}"
