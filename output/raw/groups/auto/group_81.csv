@pavlovthecorgi6.jpg,"(168, 300)",0.0097646713256835,0.56,"The dog in the image appears to have physical characteristics of the following breeds:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - The dog exhibits the typical physical traits of a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, including the recognizable facial structure, ear shape and size, and coat pattern.
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - Although less common than the Pembroke, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi is similar in appearance and could also be a possibility based on the overall look.
3. Shetland Sheepdog - This breed can sometimes be confused with Welsh Corgis due to similar coat patterns and colors, though Shetland Sheepdogs typically have a different body structure.

However, based on the image, the dog most closely resembles a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 155, 'total_tokens': 436}"

However, if you're looking at a dog with distinct features such as short legs, a long body, upright ears, and perhaps a tricolored coat, it might be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi or a Cardigan Welsh Corgi. These two breeds are often mistaken for each other but have some differences; for instance, Cardigan Welsh Corgis have longer tails. If you describe the dog you're looking at, I might be able to help you narrow it down based on description alone.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 119, 'total_tokens': 400}"
