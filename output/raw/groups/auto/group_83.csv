1. Jack Russell Terrier: This is a common breed known for its white coat with brown or black patches, compact size, and energetic natureâ€”a good match for the dog in the image.
2. Rat Terrier: Rat Terriers often have a similar appearance to Jack Russell Terriers with their short coat, color patterns, and body shape.
3. Fox Terrier (Smooth): Similar to the Jack Russell Terrier with a predominantly white coat and similar size and head shape.

It's important to note that without a professional assessment it can be challenging to determine the exact breed, and many dogs are mixed breeds exhibiting characteristics of multiple breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 152, 'total_tokens': 943}"
@pipperontour7.jpg,"(980, 980)",0.3408193588256836,1.0,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, here are three possible breeds or breed mixes that this dog might be:

1. Jack Russell Terrier - The dog has a white coat with brown markings that are common for Jack Russells, and the size and shape of the face also suggest this breed.
2. Rat Terrier - Rat Terriers can have a similar appearance to Jack Russell Terriers with a smooth coat and similar color patterns.
3. Fox Terrier (Smooth) - This breed shares the smaller size and coloring, as well as the attentive expression seen in the dog pictured.

Keep in mind that without definitive information about the dog's ancestry, this is a speculative assessment based on visual characteristics.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 143, 'total_tokens': 934}"
