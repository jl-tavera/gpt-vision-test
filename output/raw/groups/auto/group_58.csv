@lecorgi7.jpg,"(736, 919)",0.0822439193725586,0.8008705114254625,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, with its distinct physical characteristics such as the large, erect ears, elongated body, and dense coat, it most closely resembles a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. It's important to note that while breeds can generally be identified by physical traits, there can be individual variation and sometimes mixed breeds may share characteristics of purebreds. Here are three likely breed options for the dog pictured, though the primary likelihood is the Pembroke Welsh Corgi:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi (another breed of Corgi with similar features, though typically they have a different tail and body shape) 
3. A mix that includes Corgi, possibly with some other breed influencing characteristics such as color or fur texture

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the most likely breed for the dog in the image.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 184, 'total_tokens': 975}"

@loki_the_wolfdog0.jpg,"(1400, 1151)",0.2727785110473633,1.2163336229365769,"Based on the image provided, the dog could possibly be one of the following breeds:

1. Siberian Husky - This is a likely breed considering the dog's thick coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive facial markings that are common characteristics of Siberian Huskies.

2. Alaskan Malamute - Similar to the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute has a dense coat and wolf-like features. They are typically larger and more robust than Huskies.

3. Samoyed - While they typically have an all-white coat, Samoyeds also have thick, fluffy fur similar to the dog in the image. However, Samoyeds usually have a more ""smiling"" expression compared to the dog shown.

It's important to note that without professional breed identification or genetic testing, it's impossible to determine the exact breed of the dog from an image. The dog could also be a mix of different breeds sharing physical characteristics with the ones listed above.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 198, 'total_tokens': 989}"
@loki_the_wolfdog1.jpg,"(880, 879)",0.1955823898315429,1.0011376564277588,"The dog in the image most closely resembles the Siberian Husky breed, which is known for its thick fur, upright ears, and distinctive markings. While it's not possible for me to give a definitive breed identification just from the image alone, here are three possible breeds based on the visual characteristics:

1. Siberian Husky - Known for their thick double coat, friendly demeanor, and wolf-like appearance, they have a similar facial mask and fur patterns to the dog in the image.
2. Alaskan Malamute - These dogs are larger and heavier than Siberian Huskies and have a similar thick fur coat, but they can look quite similar especially in a relaxed pose like this.
3. Samoyed - While generally lighter in color, Samoyeds have a similar fluffy coat and could display a similar relaxed demeanor, though the facial structure and coloration in this image are not typical of the breed.

The dog's exact breed can only be confirmed through a closer inspection, breed papers, or a DNA test.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 207, 'total_tokens': 998}"
