Based on its specific features such as the fluffy white coat with some grey markings, large expressive eyes, and the overall facial structure, here are three breeds that might resemble this dog:

1. Shih Tzu – Known for their adorable face and long, luxurious coat, which can come in various colors.
2. Maltese – Typically have a pure white coat, but when mixed with other breeds they could have markings similar to this dog.
3. Havanese – They have a long, silky coat and can also be found in a variety of colors, including patterns like the one seen on this dog.

Please note that without a definitive pedigree, it's impossible to determine the exact breed, and this dog could be a mix of multiple breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 1131, 'completion_tokens': 163, 'total_tokens': 1294}"
