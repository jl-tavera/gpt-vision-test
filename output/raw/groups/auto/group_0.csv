@Chompersthecorgi1.jpg,"(1280, 1280)",0.1071395874023437,1.0,"The dog in the image appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, identified by its distinct head shape, ear set, and facial markings. Here are three breed possibilities for the dog pictured, even though it strongly resembles a Pembroke Welsh Corgi:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - This is the most likely breed, given the physical characteristics visible in the photo.
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - Another breed of Corgi that has similar features but typically has a longer tail and can have different markings.
3. A mix involving a Corgi - Since it's sometimes difficult to determine with 100% certainty based on an image, the dog could potentially be a mix with Corgi as one of the primary breeds.

Given the detail shown in the image, the likelihood is very high that the dog is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 179, 'total_tokens': 970}"
@Chompersthecorgi10.jpg,"(2500, 1667)",0.5844554901123047,1.4997000599880024,"Based on the image, the dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, recognizable by its short stature, erect ears, and foxy face. However, if you're looking for three possible breeds that resemble the dog in the image, here they are:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi (closely related to the Pembroke Welsh Corgi but with slightly different physical features such as a long tail)
3. Shetland Sheepdog (although they generally have a longer coat, they share similar facial features)

But it's important to note that the dog in the picture closely resembles a Pembroke Welsh Corgi more than the other breeds listed.","{'prompt_tokens': 1131, 'completion_tokens': 146, 'total_tokens': 1277}"

@Chompersthecorgi12.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0140199661254882,1.0,"The dog in this image appears to be a Corgi, specifically the Pembroke Welsh Corgi breed. This can be inferred from its visible characteristics, such as its short legs, elongated body, erect ears, and the pattern and coloration of its coat. Corgis are known for these distinct features.

However, since you asked for three possible breeds, here are two other breeds that sometimes can be confused with Corgis due to some similar physical traits:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi (another breed of Corgi with a tail and slightly different body shape)
3. Shetland Sheepdog (though they have longer legs and a different body proportion compared to Corgis, they can have similar coloration)","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 160, 'total_tokens': 441}"
@Chompersthecorgi13.jpg,"(1200, 800)",0.0437231063842773,1.5,"The dog in the image appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, which is recognizable by its short stature, long body, erect ears, and distinct head shape. It's characterized by a fox-like appearance and is a popular breed known for its involvement with British royalty. While this dog seems to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, similar breeds or mixes could potentially share some of these physical characteristics. Therefore, possible similar breeds might include:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi (though they usually have a tail and differ slightly in body shape)
3. Corgi mixes (which may inherit some of the Pembroke's distinct traits)

It's important to note that it's often challenging to identify mixed breed dogs based on appearance alone, and this dog looks like a standard Pembroke Welsh Corgi.","{'prompt_tokens': 1131, 'completion_tokens': 175, 'total_tokens': 1306}"
