@madmax_fluffyroad3.jpg,"(900, 900)",0.0659818649291992,1.0,"Based on the image provided, the dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. This breed is characterized by its short legs, long body, erect ears, and foxy face. However, if we were to consider other breeds that might have some visual similarities, although less likely, they could include:

1. Cardigan Welsh Corgi – Similar to the Pembroke but often with a longer tail and slightly different body proportions.
2. Shetland Sheepdog – Also known as the ""Sheltie,"" it has a similar coat and foxy face but is generally taller with longer legs.
3. American Corgi – A breed that is the result of crossbreeding between the Cardigan Welsh Corgi and the Pembroke Welsh Corgi.

The most accurate assessment, given the visual cues in the photo, is that this dog is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 183, 'total_tokens': 974}"

They are recognizable by their short stature, upright ears, and long body. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is known for its active and intelligent nature, as well as being a favored breed of Queen Elizabeth II. While these dogs resemble the typical features of a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, without professional verification, it's not possible to be certain of their breed just from the image. However, based on visual characteristics, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the most likely breed. Other breeds with somewhat similar appearances, though not as likely, could include the Cardigan Welsh Corgi (which typically has a longer tail) and mixes that have some Corgi characteristics.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 152, 'total_tokens': 433}"

However, since I'm unable to visually analyze this image, here are three breeds with some similar characteristics that people might guess from a description:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - Known for their short stature, foxy face, and pointy ears.
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - Similar to the Pembroke but with a longer tail and slightly different body shape.
3. Shetland Sheepdog - They have a similar look due to their herding dog heritage but are generally taller and have a longer snout.

Without visual capabilities, I can't confirm the exact breed of the dog, but the description fits best with a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 165, 'total_tokens': 446}"
@madmax_fluffyroad6.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0076913833618164,1.0,"Based on the image you've provided, the dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, which is recognizable by its short stature, elongated body, and perky ears. It displays the typical coat pattern and colors often seen in this breed. Here are three possible breeds it might be considered, primarily based on visual similarities:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi – It has the distinct physical traits of this breed.
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi – Another type of Corgi that is similar but has some differences, such as a tail and slightly different body shape.
3. Swedish Vallhund – Sometimes resembles the Corgi breeds but has a heritage of its own, typically with a heavier coat and slightly taller stature.

However, given the strong resemblance to the typical characteristics, the dog in the picture is most likely a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 179, 'total_tokens': 460}"
