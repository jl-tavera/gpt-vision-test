@mayathedox4.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0124845504760742,1.0,"I can't directly identify specific dogs in photos, but based on the general appearance of this dog, here are three possible breeds:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - Known for their short legs, long body, and friendly and intelligent demeanor.
2. Shetland Sheepdog (Sheltie) - They have a similar facial structure and can sometimes resemble a smaller Rough Collie.
3. German Shepherd Mix - The dog's facial features and coat color could suggest it might be a mix with components of a German Shepherd's characteristics.

It's important to note that without more details, pinpointing the exact breed or mix can be challenging, and a DNA test is the most reliable way to determine a dog's breed heritage.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 147, 'total_tokens': 428}"
@mayathedox5.jpg,"(735, 825)",0.0560235977172851,0.8909090909090909,"The dog in the image appears to be a Dachshund, evident from its long body shape, short legs, and distinctive facial features. Given that you've asked for three possible breeds, I will list two other breeds, but please note that these other breeds may not closely match the physical characteristics observable in the image:

1. Dachshund (most likely)
2. Beagle (although Beagles typically have different coloring and proportions)
3. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (they have similar coat texture and expressive eyes; however, they have a different body structure)

Out of these three, the dog in the picture closely resembles a Dachshund.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 136, 'total_tokens': 927}"
@mayathedox6.jpg,"(736, 919)",0.0910797119140625,0.8008705114254625,"Based on the image, the dog appears to be a puppy with features that could be found in several different breeds. Three possible breeds the puppy might be related to are:

1. Golden Retriever: The puppy's golden coat and floppy ears are characteristic of a Golden Retriever, particularly in their early stages of life.
2. Cocker Spaniel: The soft, wavy fur and the shape of the face could also suggest this puppy has some Cocker Spaniel lineage.
3. Labrador Retriever: The overall physique and facial characteristics could indicate that the puppy might be a Labrador Retriever, which can sometimes have a lighter coat color.

It's important to note that without a DNA test or pedigree information, identifying a dog's breed with certainty can be challenging, especially with puppies as they change a lot as they grow. This puppy could also be a mix of several breeds.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 181, 'total_tokens': 972}"
@mayathedox7.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0111274719238281,1.0,"Based on the image you provided, the dog appears to have characteristics similar to the following breeds:

1. Dachshund - The dog's long body and short legs, along with its floppy ears, are characteristic of a Dachshund.

2. Cocker Spaniel - While the dog doesn't immediately resemble a Cocker Spaniel, some people might mistake its wavy fur and ear shape with those of a young Cocker Spaniel puppy.

3. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel - Like the previous breed, some might see similarities due to the floppy ears and soft expression, especially when the dog is a puppy.

However, the most matching breed appears to be a Dachshund, specifically a long-haired variety.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 148, 'total_tokens': 429}"
