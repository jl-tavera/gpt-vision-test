1. Maltese: Known for their white, silky fur and spunky personality.
2. Bichon Frise: A breed often recognized by their fluffy white coat and cheerful demeanor.
3. Maltipoo: This is a mixed breed dog, a cross between a Maltese and a Poodle, and it often has the soft, curly coat and friendly temperament shown in the picture. 

Keep in mind that without a pedigree, it's not always possible to be certain about a dog's breed, especially if it’s a mixed breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 146, 'total_tokens': 427}"

However, given these traits, here are three possible breeds or types that the dog might be:

1. Shih Tzu - They often have underbites and long, flowing coats, although the hair on this dog appears to be trimmed in a non-typical style for a Shih Tzu.

2. Lhasa Apso - This breed also has a longer coat and can have a similar facial structure with an underbite.

3. Mixed Breed - This dog may very well be a mix of several toy or small-sized breeds, which can often result in a unique appearance that may not fit the standard look of a specific breed.

Without a clearer view and more details, it's hard to determine the exact breed with certainty.","{'prompt_tokens': 451, 'completion_tokens': 181, 'total_tokens': 632}"
@popeyethefoodie6.jpg,"(960, 1200)",0.1684675216674804,0.8,"Based on the appearance of the dog in the image, it seems to be a small breed with a shaggy coat. It could possibly be one of the following breeds or a mix that includes characteristics of these breeds:

1. Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie) – Known for their fine, silky hair and compact size, they can have similar facial features and coat coloring as the dog in the photo.
2. Shih Tzu – With a cute, short-faced appearance and long, flowing coats that can be groomed in various styles, including the sort of trimmed face we see here.
3. Lhasa Apso – Having a longer muzzle and similar coat textures, they can also exhibit the coloring and playful expression seen in this dog.
