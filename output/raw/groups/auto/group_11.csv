1. Golden Retriever – The dog's medium to long coat, golden color, and build suggest it is likely a Golden Retriever, which is known for these characteristics.

2. Labrador Retriever – While this dog appears to have a longer coat than the typical Labrador Retriever, some individuals might have a slightly longer coat, and the size and overall shape could be consistent with a Labrador, particularly if it's a mixed breed with some Golden Retriever ancestry.

3. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever – This breed has a similar build and coloration to the Golden Retriever, but is typically smaller in size. It may be difficult to discern the exact size from this image, but it's another possible breed.

Without more specific attributes, it's challenging to definitively determine the breed, but based on the fluffy coat and color, the Golden Retriever seems most likely.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 207, 'total_tokens': 998}"
@balooitsme0.jpg,"(1080, 1080)",0.0991706848144531,1.0,"Based on the image provided, the dog appears to be a small breed with curly fur, which is a characteristic of several breeds and mixes. Here are three possible breeds that the dog could be:

1. Toy Poodle – Known for their curly, hypoallergenic coats and intelligence, Toy Poodles are a common purebred dog that matches the appearance of the dog in the image.

2. Miniature Poodle – Slightly larger than the Toy Poodle but sharing similar characteristics including curly fur and a wide range of coat colors.

3. Bichon Frise – These dogs have a fluffy, white coat that is also curly. Although the dog in the picture is not white, Bichon Frises can sometimes have cream or apricot shades in their coat.

Keep in mind that the dog could also be a mix of breeds that share similar traits, such as a Cavapoo (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Poodle mix) or Maltipoo (Maltese and Poodle mix), which can have the curly coat depicted in the image. Without a definitive genetic test, it is not possible to say for sure which breed the dog is.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 238, 'total_tokens': 1029}"

1. Poodle – The dog has a curly coat, which is a hallmark of the Poodle breed.
2. Labradoodle – This is a cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle, known for their wavy to curly coat and friendly demeanor.
3. Goldendoodle – A cross between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle, with a coat that can range from straight to curly.

These breeds are known for their curly or wavy fur and can be similar in appearance. The exact breed would depend on other specific characteristics and, sometimes, on knowing the dog's lineage.","{'prompt_tokens': 1131, 'completion_tokens': 154, 'total_tokens': 1285}"
