@jiffpom9.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0064296722412109,1.0,"The dog in the image appears to be a Pomeranian, which is a breed known for their fluffy coats and small, fox-like faces. Here are three possible breeds based on the image, although the most likely breed is listed first:

1. Pomeranian – This is the most likely breed given the distinctive fluffy coat, compact size, and facial structure depicted in the image.
2. Keeshond – While this breed is larger and typically has different markings, they share the thick fur and a somewhat similar face shape.
3. American Eskimo Dog – This breed can resemble a Pomeranian in facial features and coat but is usually larger and has more white in its coat.

The image provided is quite distinctive for a Pomeranian, so it is highly likely that this is the correct breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 162, 'total_tokens': 443}"
@lecorgi1.jpg,"(300, 300)",0.0146093368530273,1.0,"Based on the image provided, the dog appears to resemble the following breeds:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - Notable for its short legs, foxy face, and erect ears.
2. Shetland Sheepdog - Although they typically have a more slender face, some individuals may have a broader face.
3. Finnish Lapphund - Known for their plush coat and similar foxy features.

Without a clear view of the dog's body shape and size, it is challenging to make a definitive breed determination. These suggestions are based on visible features that are common in the breeds mentioned.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 121, 'total_tokens': 402}"
@lecorgi10.jpg,"(700, 467)",0.0496397018432617,1.4989293361884368,"Based on the image you provided, the dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. This breed is characterized by its short legs, long body, erect ears, and fox-like face. However, if you are looking for three possible breeds, here are three guesses based on typical visual traits:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi
3. A mix that includes Corgi traits

Both Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh Corgis have similar physical characteristics, including the distinct body shape, but there are some differences such as tail length and body size that differentiate the two. If the dog in the picture is a mix, it could potentially combine aspects of the Corgi with another breed, but the predominant features suggest a strong Corgi influence.","{'prompt_tokens': 451, 'completion_tokens': 164, 'total_tokens': 615}"
@lecorgi11.jpg,"(225, 225)",0.0109720230102539,1.0,"The dog in the image appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi based on its physical characteristics, such as the medium-length coat, erect ears, and relatively short stature. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is known for its foxy appearance and is one of the two breeds commonly known as Welsh Corgis, the other being the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Here are three possible breeds it could be, considering its visual appearance:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi (though they typically have slightly different markings and tail)
3. A mix involving a Corgi breed due to the strong resemblance in the face and body shape.

Keep in mind, without a closer inspection and additional information, it's not possible to definitely identify the dog's breed.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 164, 'total_tokens': 445}"
