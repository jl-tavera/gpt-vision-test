@Chompersthecorgi2.jpg,"(720, 720)",0.0454292297363281,1.0,"Based on the image provided, the dog appears to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, which is characterized by its short stature, large erect ears, and foxy face. Here are three possible breeds based on the image:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - This is the most likely breed, as the physical characteristics very closely match those common to the breed.

2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - This is another type of Corgi that looks similar to the Pembroke Welsh Corgi but typically has a longer tail and might have slightly different markings.

3. Shetland Sheepdog mix - While this dog does not look much like a Shetland Sheepdog, someone might suggest a mixed breed with some Sheltie traits, especially considering the size and the shape of the ears.

However, based on this image, the dog seems to be a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.","{'prompt_tokens': 791, 'completion_tokens': 184, 'total_tokens': 975}"

However, without a clear view of the entire dog, it's challenging to be certain. Based on the visible characteristics, here are three possible breeds the dog might be:

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi
3. Corgi mix (since mixed breeds can have varied appearances)

These breeds are often confused with each other, and mixes may share characteristics of both.","{'prompt_tokens': 281, 'completion_tokens': 117, 'total_tokens': 398}"
