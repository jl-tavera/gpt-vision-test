1. Staffordshire Bull Terrier: They are known for their muscular build, short coat, and broad head.
2. American Pit Bull Terrier: Similar in appearance to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier but often larger, with a well-defined muscular structure.
3. American Staffordshire Terrier: Similar to the American Pit Bull Terrier, with perhaps a slightly different head shape and size.

Without a full view of the dog's body and without knowing its actual genetics, it's challenging to provide an accurate breed identification. The breeds listed are based on visual similarities and common characteristics; however, appearance-based breed identification is not always accurate, especially in mixed-breed dogs.","{'prompt_tokens': 1131, 'completion_tokens': 161, 'total_tokens': 1292}"
