1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi (a close relative of the Pembroke, differentiated often by tail length and some other physical traits)
3. Mixed-breed with predominant Corgi characteristics

1. Siberian Husky: They are generally smaller than Malamutes and have a lighter build.
2. Greenland Dog: They share similar features with Malamutes, being another sled dog bred for cold climates.
3. Samoyed: Another northern breed with a thick coat, but generally, Samoyeds are white and have a different facial structure.
