Given the traits in the images, a Pembroke is the most likely identification.

1. Pembroke Welsh Corgi - As previously mentioned, the most likely breed based on the visible characteristics.
2. Cardigan Welsh Corgi - Although generally they have different characteristics such as a tail, from the images provided one might mistake them if the tail is not visible.
3. A mixed breed - It's also possible that the dog could be a mix that includes Corgi, which could account for the distinctive Corgi appearance.
