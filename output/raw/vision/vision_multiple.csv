3. Alaskan Husky: This is not a recognized purebred but rather a type or category of dog typically used for sled dog racing and is typically mixed from various Nordic breeds, including the Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute, among others.

3. Poodle Mix: They might also be mixed breed dogs that have Poodle in their ancestry. Poodles are often crossed with other breeds to create ""designer dogs"" known for having hypoallergenic coats. Examples include the Cockapoo (Cocker Spaniel/Poodle mix) and the Maltipoo (Maltese/Poodle mix).
