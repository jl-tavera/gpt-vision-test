It's not possible to be completely certain without more information, but the breed's unique physical characteristics make it a strong likelihood. 

This specific breed doesn't have many variations that are drastically different in appearance like some other breeds do. The main differences within Dachshunds generally involve the coat type (smooth, long-haired, or wire-haired) and the color pattern, but overall, their body shape and structure remain consistent across these variations.

If one had to guess other breeds, one could consider breeds with some similar physical traits, like:

1. Basset Hound - They also have a long body and short legs, with droopy ears, but are typically larger and heavier than Dachshunds.
2. Beagle - Some have a similar head shape and expressive eyes, but they differ significantly in body proportions.
3. Miniature Pinscher - Although they have a more compact build, the head shape and coloring can sometimes be reminiscent of a Dachshund's appearance.
